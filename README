 -[ HackTV - Analogue TV transmitter for the HackRF ]-

This is a fork of https://github.com/fsphil/hacktv with some additional features
added. Most of them are those which I personally use, though not necessarily
warrant inclusions into original source.

I will try and keep this as up to date as possible with official releases.

**All credit for original code goes to author.**

2020-08-05:
Added HTB+ Russia for Syster
Added Videocrypt PPV mode for use with old phone cards
  - Requires either dumping of phone card or brute forcing key
    Card serial are bits 0 to 39 (each of the five bytes bit-reversed)
    Card key are bits 40 to 49 (each byte is bit reversed)
    Put this data in _ppv_card_data[] in videocrypt.c
  
  Alternatively:
  - Use --showserial parameter to display card's serial on screen
  - Use --findkey to brute force the two random bytes. 
    You need to watch the screen until it clears and it may take up to 45 hours!
    If the process is interrupted, you can change starting values in videocrypt.c
    
    /* Starting keys */
    _ppv_card_data[5] = 0x00; /* Key a */
    _ppv_card_data[6] = 0x00; /* Key b */

2020-07-24:
Added sizing options for 4:3 screens (--letterbox and --pillarbox).

2020-05-13:
Added ability to enable and disable Multichoice Videocrypt2 cards (experimental - at your own risk!).
Small tidy-ups.

2020-04-24:
Added Eurocrypt S2 mode with additional cards/modes (experimental).

2020-04-21:
Added Eurocrypt double-cut scrambling for MAC modes.
  - Activate with --double-cut. See help for options.

2020-04-17:
Added ability to display subtitles - either those within a container or external srt.
  - Active with --subtitle <subtitle index> parameter (optional argument)
Added Eurocrypt M scrambling for MAC modes.
  - Activate with --eurocrypt <mode>. See help for options.

2020-02-07:
Added ability to enable or disable Sky 07 and 09 cards.
  - Activate with --enableemm/--disableemm <card_serial> (first 8 digits)
Added --showecm option for conditional access debugging.
Added ability to use Videocrypt I and II together in most modes.
Some updates to Syster code.

2020-01-09:
Removed 'pirate' option from Syster. Use 'premiere-fa' mode and the updated hex file. 

2020-01-07:
All available Syster modes are now using random control words.
See hacktv command line help for options.

2020-01-06:
Added Canal+ Poland key "free access" (audience 11) mode. Should work with most C+ PL keys.
Added Canal+ France key "free access" (audience 11) mode. Should work with most C+ France keys.
Fixed D11.

2020-01-02:
Added Syster DES function for random control words.
'syster' parameter now requires 'premiere' or 'pirate' option.
New hex file for PIC - use your own decryption keys.

2019-12-27:
Videocrypt 2 conditional access mode added.
  - use Multichoice Central Europe card or included hex file for PIC16F84 card.
General tidy ups.
'key' option removed - see help from hacktv.

2019-12-11:
Added Sky 10 (0A) series card to Videocrypt.
  - Activate with --key sky10
  - Activate with --key sky10ppv for PPV event (samples taken from Tyson fight in '96)

2019-12-06:
Added Sky 07 (and maybe 06) series card to Videocrypt.
  - Activate with --key sky07
General tidy-ups.

2019-07-26:
Added Sky 09 series card to Videocrypt.
  - Activate with --key sky09
  - Sky 11 series can be activated with --key sky11
Minor changes and tidy-ups.

2019-05-17:
Added Discret 11 scrambling in audience 7/free access mode. Use --d11 option.
  - Best results with sampling rate 10MHz or 20MHz (until I figure out how to delay properly)
Added PIC hex file for Syster and D11 when used in Syster decoder.

2019-04-30:
Holding screen for when position of the video is defined - can sometimes takes a few seconds.
Added xtea algo for Videocrypt 1. Use --key xtea option.
Added Funcard hex for Videocrypt 1.

2019-04-25:
Merged hardware support for Syster from original repository.

Changes and additions:
Control Word change for Videocrypt TAC mode - tested working on a real TAC card.
Widescreen/anamorphic videos are now appropriately letterboxed instead of being stretched vertically.

Extra options added:
  --position <value>  Set start position of video in minutes.
  --timestamp         Overlay video timestamp over video.
  --logo <path>       Overlay picture logo over video. Logos are kept in
                      resources/logos folder.

2019-04-07:
PAL FM deviation changed to 6000000 kHz and default signal level reduced to 0.8

Conditional Videocrypt mode requires --key sky|tac parameter. This specifies
which card you want to use to decode video. 

  sky09 = this works with an active Sky 09 series card and uses randomly generated 
          control words.
  sky11 = this works with an active Sky 11 series card (blue semi-oval logo) and 
          uses two fixed control words.
  tac   = this works with an active The Adult Channel or Eurotica card and uses 
          randomly generated control words.

  Hex files for "sky09" and "tac" modes are included in PIC directory to flash 
  your own PIC16F84 based cards. Old pirate D2MAC cards based on this chip will 
  work. These cards are also known as "Goldwafer" or "Multimac" - only PIC chip
  needs to be flashed. External EEPROM is not used.

**Original README text is below.**

WHAT'S IT DO

Generates a PAL, NTSC, SECAM*, D/D2-MAC video signal from a video file, stream
or test pattern. Also supports older 819, 405, 240 and 30 line standards, as
well as the NASA Apollo video standards, both colour and mono.

Input is any file type or URL supported by ffmpeg.

Output can be to a file, HackRF, fl2k-supported VGA adaptors or any SDR
supported by SoapySDR.

It also supports:

+ Teletext (625-line only)
+ NICAM stereo audio
+ Videocrypt I/II/S hardware support
+ Partial Nagravision Syster hardware support
+ Analogue Copy Protection system, similar to Macrovision
+ Eurocrypt hardware support

* SECAM support is very basic and won't produce a good image


WHAT'S IT NOT DO (yet)

+ There are no filters. Needed for proper audio and VSB modulation
+ An optional notch filter for the colour subcarrier would be nice


WHAT IT WON'T DO

+ DVB or other pure digital signals
+ Bring back Firefly :(
