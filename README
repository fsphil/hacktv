 -[ HackTV - Analogue TV transmitter for the HackRF ]-

WHAT'S IT DO

Generates a PAL/NTSC video signal from a video file or test pattern.
Input is any file type or URL supported by ffmpeg.
Output can be to a file or directly to a HackRF.
Teletext support.
NICAM stereo audio.
Rudimentary Videocrypt I hardware support.

WHAT'S IT NOT DO (yet)

There are no filters. Needed for proper audio and VSB modulation.
An optional notch filter for the colour subcarrier would be nice.
SECAM colour. More of my TVs support this than NTSC.
D-MAC / D2-MAC standards. Because SECAM isn't obscure enough.

WHAT IT WON'T DO

DVB or other pure digital signals.
Bring back Firefly. :(

* For Debian and related
apt-get update
apt-get install libhackrf-dev libavutil-dev libavdevice-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

INSTALL

make

EXAMPLES

# Generate a file containing a PAL baseband signal from a video
$ hacktv -o baseband.bin -m pal example.mkv

# Transmit a test pattern on UHF channel 31 (PAL System I), 47dB TX gain
$ hacktv -f 551250000 -m i -g 47 test

# Transmit a test pattern on UHF channel 30 (NTSC), 47dB TX gain, TX amplifier
$ hacktv -f 567250000 -m m -g 47 -a -s 13500000 test

# Transmit a test pattern with teletext
$ hacktv -f 551250000 -m i -g 47 --teletext demo.tti test

# Download and transmit teletext pages from the Teefax service
# http://teastop.co.uk/teletext/
$ svn checkout http://teastop.plus.com/svn/teletext/ teefax
$ hacktv -f 551250000 -m i -g 47 --teletext teefax test
